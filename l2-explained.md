# Layer 2 Explained

Layer 2 solutions are built on top of a base blockchain (Layer 1) to improve scalability and reduce transaction costs.

## Why Layer 2 Exists

Layer 1 networks like Ethereum prioritize decentralization and security, but this can limit transaction speed and increase fees.

## What Are Rollups?

Rollups bundle multiple transactions together and submit them to Layer 1 as a single batch.

This reduces congestion and lowers costs per user.
