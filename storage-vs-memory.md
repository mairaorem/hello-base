# Storage vs Memory

Solidity uses different data locations for variables.

The two most important are:

- Storage
- Memory

## Storage

Storage variables are permanently stored on-chain.

They are expensive to modify because they change blockchain state.

## Memory

Memory variables exist temporarily during function execution.

They are not stored permanently on-chain.

Memory is cheaper than storage.
